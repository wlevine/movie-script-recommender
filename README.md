This is designed to be a supplement for a collaborative-filtering movie recommender system
based on [softImpute](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/swData/softImpute/vignette.html).
The idea is that for a movie which has only a small number of ratings, the factors
can be obtained by looking at the script rather than from softImpute.
